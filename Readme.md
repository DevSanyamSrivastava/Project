Backend Tutorial Project
This project is a backend tutorial built with Node.js and Express.js. It demonstrates a well-organized structure using controllers, middlewares, models, and routes to handle various aspects of backend logic. It includes features like authentication (using JWT), file uploads (with Multer), error handling, and API response utilities.
